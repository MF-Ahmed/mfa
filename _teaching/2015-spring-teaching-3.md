Deep learning-based Distributed UAV Target Detection over Multi-sensor Network
======

This project implemented distributed cooperative UAV target detection in Gazebo using CenterNet. Four observing UAVs with cameras tracked a moving target UAV. Images captured simultaneously were processed by a trained CenterNet model for target detection. In the information fusion phase, local detection results were combined in a distributed manner using an average consensus algorithm at the decision layer.
