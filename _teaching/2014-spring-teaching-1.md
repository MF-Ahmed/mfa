The objective of this lab is to implement and experiment with the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for localization and Occupancy Grid Mapping using real driving data. The selected dataset is the recently released NuScenes, which features diverse driving scenarios (primarily in urban environments) with high-quality annotations. Along with this lab, skeleton code is provided to outline the necessary steps for both algorithms. The task is to complete the code and evaluate the results.
