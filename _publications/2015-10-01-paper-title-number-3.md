excerpt: 'This article introduces a utility function for Active SLAM (A-SLAM) that combines map entropy with D-Optimality criteria to prioritize goal frontier selection. The function leverages occupancy grid maps, emphasizing unknown areas for maximum coverage while minimizing localization and mapping uncertainties. Efficiency is assessed through graph connectivity metrics and map efficiency indices in exploration tasks. Simulations and experiments on public datasets demonstrate a 32% improvement in area coverage compared to similar methods.'

In this article we present a utility function for Active SLAM (A-SLAM) which utilizes map entropy along
 with D-Optimality criterion metrices for weighting goal frontier candidates. We propose a utility function for frontier goal
 selection that exploits the occupancy grid map by utilizing the path entropy and favors unknown map locations for maximum
 area coverage while maintaining a low localization and mapping uncertainties. We quantify the efficiency of our method using
 various graph connectivity matrices and map efficiency indexes for an environment exploration task. Using simulation and
 experimental results against similar approaches we achieve an average of 32% more coverage using publicly available data sets.
