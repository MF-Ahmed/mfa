excerpt: 'This article presents an efficient multi-robot active SLAM framework featuring a frontier-sharing method to maximize exploration in unknown environments. The approach promotes robot distribution while weighting goal frontiers based on pose graph SLAM uncertainty and path entropy. By using a limited set of frontier points and a utility function that accounts for SLAM and map uncertainties, the method ensures efficiency without high computational costs. Tested in simulations and real-world scenarios, it achieves 31% greater coverage than state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for environment exploration.'

In this article, we present an efficient multi-robot active SLAM framework that involves a frontier-sharing method
 for maximum exploration of an unknown environment. It encourages the robots to spread into the environment while
 weighting the goal frontiers with the pose graph SLAM uncertainly and path entropy. Our approach works on a limited
 number of frontier points and weights the goal frontiers with a utility function that encapsulates both the SLAM and
 map uncertainties, thus providing an efficient and not computationally expensive solution. Our approach has been
 tested on publicly available simulation environments and on real robots. An accumulative 31% more coverage than
 similar state-of-the-art approaches has been obtained, proving the capability of our approach for efficient environment
 exploration.
