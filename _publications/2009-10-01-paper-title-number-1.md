 This article presents a comprehensive review of the Active Simultaneous Localization
 and Mapping (A-SLAM) research conducted over the past decade. It explores the formulation,
 applications, and methodologies employed in A-SLAM, particularly in trajectory generation and
 control-action selection, drawing on concepts from Information Theory (IT) and the Theory ofOptimal
 Experimental Design (TOED). This review includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses of
 various approaches, deployment scenarios, configurations, path-planning methods, and utility
 functions within A-SLAM research. Furthermore, this article introduces a novel analysis of Active
 Collaborative SLAM (AC-SLAM), focusing on collaborative aspects within SLAM systems. It includes
 a thorough examination of collaborative parameters and approaches, supported by both qualitative
 andstatistical assessments. This study also identifies limitations in the existing literature and suggests
 potential avenues for future research. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking
 insights into A-SLAM methods and techniques, offering a current overview of A-SLAM formulation.
