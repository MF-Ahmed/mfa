In this talk, I address Active Collaborative SLAM (AC-SLAM), where multiple robots work together to explore and map unknown environments. I present our work presented in the paper, which proposes a visual AC-SLAM method combining aerial and ground robots. This method includes an efficient frontier filtering approach to optimize exploration by reducing redundant frontiers. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to guide robots to previously visited locations, enhancing loop closure and reducing SLAM uncertainty.
