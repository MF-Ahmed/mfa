 I present our work in the referenced paper where we propose an efficient centralized frontier-sharing approach that optimizes exploration by evaluating information gain, distance, and rewards for frontier candidates while promoting agent dispersion. Our method ensures maximum exploration with minimal SLAM uncertainty. We also introduce two coordination strategies, synchronous and asynchronous, for prioritizing robot goal assignments via a central server.
